# GrumBot
I want a desk buddy and like Hermitcraft. The bot will answer questions when prompted with a button press along with other functions. 
Update; its turning into a whiny child (its all my doing but still)

Current Features: 
- Answers prompts when the button is pressed
- Sounds the alarm if feels neglected (screams and flashes the led)
